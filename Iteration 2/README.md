## Iteration 2: Support Primary Functionality

#### Step 1 would normally be review of inputs, but that's already been done, thus it has been removed for simplicity.  


###### Step 1: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers
##### Use Cases
* UC-2
* UC-3
* UC-9
##### Quality Attributes
* QA-2
* QA-3
* QA-9
###### Step 2: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Decompose
The main goal of this iteration was to implement key features like course information access as well as course time modification. These are the primary functions of our system.
###### Step 3/4: Choose One or More Design Concepts that Satisfy the Selected Drivers and Instantiate Architectural Elements
As the main structure of the system was implemented in the first iteration, the second iteration was used to expand upon the current structure. Through a layered three tier architecture, the system will allow for the implementation of the use cases with relative ease.

###### Step 5: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions
No model is needed for the addition of the new functionality

##### Step 6: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal and Design Objectives
Addressed through the use of the Kanban board as per project instructions.
