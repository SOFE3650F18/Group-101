## Iteration 1: Structure the System

#### Step 1 would normally be review of inputs, but that's already been done, thus it has been removed for simplicity.  

#### Step 1: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers  
##### Use Cases
* UC-1
* UC-4
* UC-5
* UC-6
* UC-7
##### Quality Attributes
* QA-1
* QA-4
* QA-5
* QA-6
* QA-7
##### Constraints
* CON-1
* CON-2
* CON-3
* CON-4
* CON-5
* CON-6
###### Step 2: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine    
Given the goal of the first iteration is to structure the sytem, we want to refine the use of backups, management of system downtime, login system and access levels of users, a structured messaging system and lastly working storage and searching of courses.   
###### Step 3 & 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts that Satisfy the Selected Drivers/Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilities and Define Interfaces   
In order to best accomodate all types of users, to allow for the best access to the system and for security purposes the ideal solution for this system would be a web based interface.
As such, the system will encorporate a Three Tier Architecture, wherein the backend system will store the information about users, courses, and any other necessary support features.
The system should also follow the Model-View-Controller Pattern (MVC) as this pattern is among the best notably for web based applications. 

###### Step 5: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions  

###### Step 6: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal and Design Objectives  
Addressed through the use of the Kanban board as per project instructions.
